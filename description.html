                <h1>Scenario</h1>
                <p>
                    Jenifer is an international graduate student in Computer Science. She has recently moved abroad to pursue her master’s degree.
                    As an international student, moving away from home comes with a lot of responsibilities and tasks to complete on a daily basis. To keep up
                    with all the workload, she considers time management tops the list, starting from waking up early in the morning to keeping track and setting up a routine
                </p>
                <h2>Use Cases</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set alarms on a daily basis</li>
                    <li>See timings around the world in one window</li>
                    <li>Set timer for a presentation/event/exam</li>
                    <li>Use a stopwatch to record the timings of an event/activity</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Set Alarm</h2>
                <p>
                    Jenifer tops her list with time management and considers that waking up early in the morning is one of the main things, so she can set an alarm on a daily basis to set a time to wake up. There are different options in an alarm clock. She can set an alarm using an analog display, or digital display. There is a toggle button to enable or disable the alarms set. There is also a button such as a ‘+’ sign to add new timings as well. She also has options like repeat the alarm for particular days or all the days of the week. She also gets to choose the tune of the alarm and vibrations. There is also an option to add new labels to each alarm set. Another interesting feature is that she can integrate the alarm with the Google Assistant. After the alarm is dismissed, the Google Assistant can tell her about that day’s forecast and her personal commute. It can also adjust the lights and thermostat, as well as play music, radio, or news. Finally, there is an option to delete the alarm.
                    Even though the clock seems to provide many features, Jenifer isn’t happy with a few things about it. The alarm clock has a single button which can be swiped either right or left. If it is swiped towards the right side, the alarm stops to ring, whereas if it is swiped to the left, the alarm goes to the snooze mode. This is not very convenient to her because when she wakes up to the alarm, she won’t be in a state to swipe it to the right direction based on what she decides to do with it.
                    Another problem is that if she is in a very deep and she fails to wake up or get alerted by the alarm, the alarm stops ringing after a certain time and she ends up missing the alarm completely.
                    Through the interface which I like to design, I will provide two different buttons for the stop mode and snooze mode. I would also like to improvise on the settings such that the alarm never stops ringing by its own unless done manually.
                </p>
                <h2>World Clock</h2>
                <p>Jenifer is an international student, she keeps track of at least two time zones. One which is her hometown where her parents live and the other where she currently resides. She can view various timings in one screen at a time. She can add different cities to that window to view the timings. One option which she would like to have is the display of at least two time zones on the home page of her phone so that she doesn’t have to open the clock application to view the timings, instead she can look at the home screen before placing a call to her parents.</p>
                <h2>Timer</h2>
                <p>
                    As stated earlier, she has various responsibilities and would like to set aside time for all her activities. For this purpose, she can easily set a timer when she starts working on one task.
                    The clock application doesn’t allow Jenifer to set multiple timers or consecutive timers. To overcome this, we can design the timer interface similar to the alarm interface to set different timers based on the tasks for the day.
                </p>
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this application is to provide the user with multiple clock/time related functions.  The user can set alarms, set timers, set a stopwatch, or view the current times of other cities around the world.  Many built in clock apps on most smartphones contain at least the functionality described in this prototype.  Even though the overall functionality of theses apps is rather limited, there are many situations in which a user might need to use this alarm app.</p>
